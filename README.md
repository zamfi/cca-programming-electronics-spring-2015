#### Homework 1 (due Wednesday, January 28, 2015)

- Solve the puzzles through level 5 at [Rudy the Red Dot](http://rudy.zamfi.net) -- these are the puzzles we solved together using "pseudocode" in class, but now you will solve them with actual code, in JavaScript. 
  
  *(The website is running on my computer at home, so it may load a bit slowly. Also, if the <strong>Run</strong> button seems to stop working, reload the page. Best results with the Chrome browser.)*

    - For puzzles that change, each time you hit the **Run** button, you'll get a new version of the puzzle. Your code should solve any variation of the puzzle you can get. Start by clicking **Run** a few times to make sure you remember what the possible variations are.
    - There's a cheat sheet of syntax on the right, under the puzzle itself.
    - **Assignment: Use at least 3 functions of at least 3 lines each while computing these puzzles.**
    - **Assignment: Use a while loop for puzzles 4 and 5.**
    - **Assignment: Email me a link to your final level (not the code, the actual URL link -- like http://rudy.zamfi.net/whatever) to [jzamfirescupereira@cca.edu](mailto: jzamfirescupereira@cca.edu) with subject RUDY FINAL LEVEL LINK by 11am, Wednesday January 28.**

- If you find yourself struggling with the basic concepts of the code, complete through puzzle 20 at [Hour of Code](http://learn.code.org/hoc/1) -- make sure you click the **Show Code** button after solving each puzzle and that you understand how that code works.

- Install [Processing](https://processing.org/download/?processing) on your computer.

- **Assignment: Follow the first 5 [Processing tutorials](https://processing.org/tutorials/)**

- **Assignment: Get extra help by going to the Hybrid Lab during staffed hours (I believe 10am-8pm) and asking the coaches for help!**

- **Assignment: Bring your computer to class on Wednesday, January 28!**

Please email me at [jzamfirescupereira@cca.edu](mailto: jzamfirescupereira@cca.edu) if you're stuck, aren't sure how to move forward, or just want to say hi! (And if you're stuck on Rudy, include the URL link to the puzzle you're stuck on!)

### Week 2: Wednesday, January 28, 2015

Lecture:
- Homework Review

Lab:
- Creating sketches. Write code to create the following sketches in Processing:

1. ![one](img/one.png)

2. ![two](img/two.png)

3. ![three](img/three.png)

4. [![four](img/four.png)](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jWNXFlGHuPA)

5. ![five](img/five.png)

6. Look through the [Processing reference](http://processing.org/reference). Pick a function, and use it in a new sketch of your own choosing.


#### Homework 2 (due Wednesday, February 4, 2015)

Programming Practice!

- **Assignment: Pick 5 of the 15 sketches below and recreate them, at least one must be animated.** Bonus points for adding flourishes to your sketches.

- Not all these sketches are equally difficult -- in fact some are very challenging!

- If you didn't follow the [Processing tutorials](https://processing.org/tutorials/) last week, then **Assignment: Do so now!**

1. Circles in a diagonal line. Use a while loop to draw the balls in sequence. What do you know about the x and y coordinates of each ball? (Spoiler: They're the same!)
   
   ![ball-diagonal](img/hw2/ball-diagonal.png)

2. Circles in a grid. You will likely need a while loop inside another while loop!
   
   ![ball-grid](img/hw2/ball-grid.png)

3. Colored circles in a grid, random version. Check out the `colorMode` function, and HSB, in the [Processing reference](http://processing.org/reference).
   
   ![ball-grid-randoms](img/hw2/ball-grid-randoms.png)

4. Colored circles in a grid, sequential version. Check out the `colorMode` function, and HSB, in the [Processing reference](http://processing.org/reference).

   ![ball-grid-rainbows](img/hw2/ball-grid-rainbows.png)

5. Circles in an triangle.

   ![ball-triangle](img/hw2/ball-triangle.png)
   
6. Circles in an hourglass.

   ![ball-hourglass](img/hw2/ball-hourglass.png)

7. The grid.
   
   ![grid](img/hw2/grid.png)
   
8. Diagonal lines.

   ![diagonal-lines](img/hw2/diagonal-lines.png)

9. Diagonal lines, interrupted.

   ![big-p](img/hw2/big-p.png)

10. Random bars.

   ![random-bars](img/hw2/random-bars.png)

11. Random bars, animated.

   [![random-bars-animated](img/hw2/random-bars-animated.png)](http://youtu.be/EA9MqlY56LM)

12. Animated bars, mouse-sensitive. Check out the Processing-defined variables `mouseX` and `mouseY` in the [Processing reference](http://processing.org/reference).

   [![random-bars-mouse](img/hw2/random-bars-mouse.png)](http://youtu.be/3OAKqXS5Lkw)

13. Bouncing balls, just two.

   [![bouncing-balls](img/hw2/bouncing-balls.png)](http://youtu.be/7sfC4-4VoM4)

14. **Challenge:** Bouncing balls, more added by clicking. You may need to use an `ArrayList`.

   [![bouncing-balls-with-clicks](img/hw2/bouncing-balls-with-click.png)](http://youtu.be/Tnkhya3Tqu0)

15. **Challenge:** Fireworks! They should track the mouse and appear on clicks.
