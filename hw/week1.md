### Homework 1 (due Wednesday, January 28, 2015)

- Solve the puzzles through level 5 at [Rudy the Red Dot](http://rudy.zamfi.net) -- these are the puzzles we solved together using "pseudocode" in class, but now you will solve them with actual code, in JavaScript. 
  
  *(The website is running on my computer at home, so it may load a bit slowly. Also, if the <strong>Run</strong> button seems to stop working, reload the page. Best results with the Chrome browser.)*

    - For puzzles that change, each time you hit the **Run** button, you'll get a new version of the puzzle. Your code should solve any variation of the puzzle you can get. Start by clicking **Run** a few times to make sure you remember what the possible variations are.
    - There's a cheat sheet of syntax on the right, under the puzzle itself.
    - **Assignment: Use at least 3 functions of at least 3 lines each while computing these puzzles.**
    - **Assignment: Use a while loop for puzzles 4 and 5.**
    - **Assignment: Email me a link to your final level (not the code, the actual URL link -- like http://rudy.zamfi.net/whatever) to [jzamfirescupereira@cca.edu](mailto: jzamfirescupereira@cca.edu) with subject RUDY FINAL LEVEL LINK by 11am, Wednesday January 28.**

- If you find yourself struggling with the basic concepts of the code, complete through puzzle 20 at [Hour of Code](http://learn.code.org/hoc/1) -- make sure you click the **Show Code** button after solving each puzzle and that you understand how that code works.

- Install [Processing](https://processing.org/download/?processing) on your computer.

- **Assignment: Follow the first 5 [Processing tutorials](https://processing.org/tutorials/)**

- **Assignment: Get extra help by going to the Hybrid Lab during staffed hours (I believe 10am-8pm) and asking the coaches for help!**

- **Assignment: Bring your computer to class on Wednesday, January 28!**

Please email me at [jzamfirescupereira@cca.edu](mailto: jzamfirescupereira@cca.edu) if you're stuck, aren't sure how to move forward, or just want to say hi! (And if you're stuck on Rudy, include the URL link to the puzzle you're stuck on!)
